* Disclaimer

The codes in this repository are a result of coding practice which I
did to be familiar with the basic concept of selenium. I uploaded this
just to archive it for future reference.

Please try a real service to delete your ancient tweets, unless it is
your wish to understand browser testing framework, learn about the tweet
webpage and delete tweets at a rate of 5 tweets per minute.


* How to run it
** requirement

The first thing is to set upÂ a selenium testing environment, the codes
are hardcode to use firefox, so you need a geckodriver.

Then you need to install the dependencies. Of course, a virtual
environment is recommended.

You also have to log in to a tweet account for it. The autologin is
not included. Because of that, the browser =profile= is a must,
copying an existing one if you don't want to spend time learning about
the firefox profile.

** script

Creating a =run.py= script to start. There is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import logging
import sys

from kainite.main import main

logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)

main(
    author='th3acc0untname',
    tweet_archive_fn='tweet/archive/dire/data/tweet.js',
    fx_profile_dir='/firefox/profile/dir/',
    rate=10,
)
#+END_SRC
